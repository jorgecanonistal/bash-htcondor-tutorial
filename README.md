*BASH and HTCondor tutorial for new lab members (Maruvka Lab).*

Created by Jorge Cano Nistal, PhD Candidate, 2023.



Welcome to this tutorial on using Bash and HTCondor! Bash is a popular Unix shell and command language, while HTCondor is a high-throughput computing software framework used for job management and scheduling. Together, they can be powerful tools for managing and executing computational tasks on clusters or grids.

In this tutorial, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to use Bash and HTCondor for job submission, monitoring, and management. We will cover the basics of Bash scripting, including variables, loops, and conditionals, as well as more advanced topics like functions and input/output redirection. We will also delve into the HTCondor architecture, configuration, and job submission process.

Whether you are a researcher looking to execute complex computations on a cluster, or a systems administrator responsible for managing a large-scale computing environment, this tutorial will provide you with the foundational knowledge and practical skills needed to effectively use Bash and HTCondor. So let's dive in and start learning!
